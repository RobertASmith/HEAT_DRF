## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(kableExtra)
setwd("C:/Users/Robert/Google Drive/Other Projects/HEAT2/HEAT_DRF")
kable(readRDS(file = "data/results.R"),format = "markdown") 

#%>%
#  kable_styling(latex_options = c("repeat_header")) %>%
#  add_header_above(c(" " = 3, "Scenario 1" = 2, "Scenario 2" = 2, "Scenario 2 3" = 2))
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
