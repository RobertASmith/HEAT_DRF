Acknowledgements:  The authors would like to thank Martin Stepanek & Marco Hafner for detailed explanations explaining their method to estimate country physical activity distributions. We would also like to thank Sonja Kahlmeier, Thomas Gostski & Alberto Castro Fernandez for providing details of and access to the HEAT model and data.

# Repository structure
- the 'scripts' folder contains the scripts necessary to replicate the analysis conducted in the paper. The distributions_create.R file creates the country level physical activity distributions as described by Hafner et al. The analysis.R undertakes the analysis discussed in the paper.
- This work was originally undertaken during a trip to Zurich in 2018, when the author was new to R. I apologise sincerely for the structure of the code, this is not how I would set this up now.
