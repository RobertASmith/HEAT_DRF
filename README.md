## Abstract
The WHO-Europe’s Health Economic Assessment Tool is a tool used to estimatethe costs and benefits of changes in walking and cycling.  Due to data limitationsthe tool’s physical activity module assumes a linear dose response relationship be-tween physical activity and mortality.   
This study estimates baseline population physical activity distributions for 44 coun-tries included in the HEAT. It then compares, for three different scenarios, the re-sults generated by the current method, using a linear dose-response relationship,with results generated using a non-linear dose-response relationship.   
The study finds that estimated deaths averted are relatively higher (lower) using thenon-linear effect in countries with less (more) active populations. This difference islargest for interventions which affect the activity levels of the least active the most.Since more active populations,  e.g.   in Eastern Europe,  also tend to have lowerValue of a Statistical Life estimates the net monetary benefit estimated by the sce-narios are much higher in western-Europe than eastern-Europe.  
Using a non-linear dose response function results in materially different estimateswhere populations are particularly inactive or particularly active.  Estimating base-line distributions is possible with limited additional data requirements, although themethod has yet to be validated.  Given the significant role of the physical activitymodule within the HEAT tool it is likely that in the evaluation of many interventionsthe monetary benefit estimates will be sensitive to the choice of the physical activity dose response function.

## Repository structure & replication
- the 'scripts' folder contains the scripts necessary to replicate the analysis conducted in the paper. 
  -  The distributions_create.R file creates the country level physical activity distributions as described by Hafner et al. 
  -  The analysis.R undertakes the analysis discussed in the paper.
- the R folder contains all functions required for the analysis.
- the 'output' folder contains the outputs generated by running the analysis.R file.
- the data folder contains data which is read in during the cleaning phase.
- This work was originally undertaken during a trip to Zurich in 2018, when the author was new to R. I apologise sincerely for the structure of the code, ideally I would refactor this code & set up the repository from scratch.

To replicate the analysis run:

``` r
source("scripts/analysis.R")
```
This will run the 'analysis.R' script which:
``` r
1) loads and cleans all necessary data, stored in the 'data' folder, data and merges the data into a single dataframe.
2) reads in the model function used to compare the three scenarios using the HEAT with a linear and a dose-response function.
3) reads in the plotting functions to visualise the results.
4) uses ""R/relativerisksplot.R"" to plot the relative risk functions based upon Woodcock et al. 
5) runs the analysis described in the publication for three different scenarios and stores results as .
6) uses 'R/all_plots.R' to read in all the results from the csvs created above, and plots the results, saving them to the 'outputs' folder.
```
As I mentioned, it would be nice to have time to refactor this code, but unfortunately this project was time limited. If you are interested in building upon this work please contact me directly.

## Plot from the analysis
![The estimated benefits of increased walking for a country depend on the shape of the dose response function between physical activity and mortality, and the distribution of physical activty in the country.](https://github.com/RobertASmith/HEAT_DRF/blob/c9bc4c6306a71a8fedbe1906d27ee4da418c8324/output/t375/figures/S1_RelativeResults.pdf)
